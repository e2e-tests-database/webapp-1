## To use SPA aplication with Angular

For the deployment we will use docker. After execute the docker script (for Windows `./start_docker.ps1` and Mac/Linux `./start_docker.sh`), the both aplication(traditional and SPA) will compiled and they deployed on the same server.

To access to SPA we will use `http://localhost:8000/` and to access at Angular we use `http://localhost:8000/new`.
